   abstract = {Public attention is frequently directed to visible macro-system impacts of events such as oil spills resulting in oil washing into estuaries, tar balls on beaches, and oiled mega-fauna. However oil and other types of accidental contaminants, such as radioactive particles, can have fundamental impacts on less-visible portions of delicate chemical and biological ecosystems. What happens to the contaminants after impact events? Where and how are the contaminants dispersed in the water column and over what distance? What long-term impacts do the contaminants have on chemical and biological ecosystems? These key questions need to be addressed over large spatial dimensions and over long time frames. This paper describes the initial steps of the development of an autonomous robotic sampling platform, deployable for long-term monitoring missions and capable of collecting samples to track contaminant dispersion.},

   abstract = {Underwater mass spectrometry systems can be used for direct in situ detection of volatile organic compounds and dissolved gases in oceans, lakes, rivers and waste-water streams. In this work we describe the design and operation of (1) a linear quadrupole mass filter and (2) a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer interfaced, in each case, with a membrane introduction/fluid control system and packaged for underwater operation. These mass spectrometry systems can operate autonomously, or under user control via a wireless rf link. Detection limits for each system were determined in the laboratory using pure solutions. The quadrupole mass filter system provides detection limits in the 1-5 ppb range with an upper mass limit of 100 amu. Its power requirement is approximately 95 Watts. The ion trap system has detection limits well below 1 ppb, an upper mass limit of 650 amu and MS/MS capability. Its power consumption is on the order of 150 Watts. The present membrane limits analysis to non-polar compounds (300 amu) with analysis cycles of 5-15 minutes. Deployments of both types of instruments are described, along with a discussion of the challenges associated with in-water mass spectrometry and descriptions of alternative in-water mass spectrometer configurations.

Real-time measurements of pollutants, tox-ins, and pathogens across a range of spatial scales are required to adequately monitor these hazards, manage the consequences, and to understand the processes governing their magnitude and distribution. Significant technological advancements have been made in recent years for the detection and analysis of such marine hazards. In particular, sensors deployed on a variety of mobile and fixed-point observing platforms provide a valuable means to assess hazards. In this review, we present state-of-the-art of sensor technology for the detection of harmful substances and organisms in the ocean. Sensors are classified by their adaptability to various platforms, addressing large, intermediate, or small areal scales. Current gaps and future demands are identified with an indication of the urgent need for new sensors to detect marine hazards at all scales in autonomous real-time mode. Progress in sensor technology is expected to depend on the development of small-scale sensor technologies with a high sensitivity and specificity towards target analytes or organisms. However, deployable systems must comply with platform requirements as these interconnect the three areal scales. Future developments will include the integration of existing methods into complex and operational sensing systems for a comprehensive strategy for long-term monitoring. The combination of sensor techniques on all scales will remain crucial for the demand of large spatial and temporal coverage.},

   abstract = {This paper is aimed at developing optimal motion planning for a single autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) equipped with an on-board pollutant sensor that will maximize the sensor-related information available for source seeking. The ASV uses a nonlinear diffusion model of the pollutant source to estimate the intensity/level of the pollution at the present ASV location. The rate of detection of particles depends on the relative distance between the ASV and the source. First, we use a probabilistic map of the source location built through the sensor information for a dynamic motion planning of source seeking based on an entropy reduction formulation, where an appropriately defined Fisher information matrix (FIM) is used for entropy reduction or information gain. We derive the FIM for the setup and investigate optimal trajectories. Next, we present an online nonlinear Monte Carlo algorithm that uses the obtained sensor information about pollutant at different vehicle locations to update a probabilistic uncertainty map of pollutant source location. As the mission unfolds the ASV motion is computed by considering a moving-horizon interval of decision, which will allow for the inclusion of new information available for optimal motion planning. The proposed motion planning approach is extended to take into account external disturbances and it is able to minimize the uncertainty in the pollutant source. Finally, we provide two case studies to demonstrate efficacy of the proposed motion planning algorithm.},

The platform is designed to have a flattened ellipsoidal exterior so as to minimize the hydrodynamic damping on the horizontal plane. Four horizontal thrusters with the identical specifications are symmetrically mounted on the horizontal plane, and each of them has the same thrust dynamics in both forward and reverse directions. In addition, there are three vertical thrusters used to handle the vehicle's roll, pitch and heave motions. Control strategy proposed in this paper to overcome strong current is that: maximizing the vectored horizontal thrust force against the sea current without or with the least of the vehicle's rotation on the horizontal plane. For the vehicle model, due to it being symmetric in all of three axes, the vehicle dynamics can be simplified and all of hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated through both of theoretical and empirically-derived formulas. Numerical simulations and experimental studies in both of the water tank and the circulating water channel are carried out to demonstrate the vehicle's capability of overcoming strong current.},

Thus, the mission plan can be modified, sampling criteria can be adjusted, and target features can be traced. This paper presents an overview of existing adaptive sampling techniques.

However, these analytical sensors are typically configured to collect and log data as independent payloads-without the benefit of feedback from other payload sensors or vehicle navigation systems. This paper explores conceptual frameworks for integrating payload sensors in various degrees of real-time data assimilation and adaptive operation. Several of the challenges to coupling chemical sensor payloads in closed-loop architecture with acoustic, visual and navigation control systems are examined. Specific examples are provided as to how information sharing and coupled decision making processes may improve payload data interpretation and validation as well as increase the overall efficiency of AUV mission strategies. Data is presented from deployments of the Seabed submersible, a passively stable, hover-capable AUV designed for operation to 2000 meters. During these deployments the Seabed vehicle was arrayed with a payload of optical, acoustic, and chemical sensors to identify and map structures associated with ocean bottom methane sources on the Atlantic slope of North America. Results from these deployments are discussed and a collection of general principles is suggested for integration of biological and chemical sensors as payload with active feedback aboard AUVs. The authors conclude with suggestions for possible scientific applications that can be addressed using levels of technology presently available as well as how incremental advancements in AUV payload integration will present profound new opportunities to explore and understand our world.},

To this purpose, we formulate the depth control problems of the AUV as continuous-state, continuous-action Markov decision processes under unknown transition probabilities. Based on the deterministic policy gradient theorem and neural network approximation, we propose a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that learns a state-feedback controller from sampled trajectories of the AUV. To improve the performance of the RL algorithm, we further propose a batch-learning scheme through replaying previous prioritized trajectories. We illustrate with simulations that our model-free method is even comparable to the model-based controllers.

Human inspections of these environments are often dangerous or infeasible, so remote inspection using unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) is used. Due to access restrictions and environmental limitations, such as low illumination levels, turbidity, and a lack of salient features, traditional localisation systems that have been developed for use in large bodies of water cannot be used. This means that UUV capabilities are severely restricted to manually controlled low-quality visual inspections, generating non-geospatially located data. The localisation of UUVs in these environments would enable the autonomous behaviour and the development of accurate maps.

Our focus is on problems requiring the autonomous discovery and dense sampling of critical areas of interest in real-time, for which standard (e.g., grid-based) strategies are not practical due to AUV power and computing constraints that limit mission duration. To this end, we consider adaptive sampling strategies on Gaussian process (GP) stochastic models of the measured scalar field to focus sampling on the most promising and informative regions. Specifically, this study employs the GP upper confidence bound as the optimization criteria to adaptively plan sampling paths that balance a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Two informative path planning algorithms based on (i) branch-and-bound techniques and (ii) cross-entropy optimization are presented for choosing future sampling locations while considering the motion constraints of the sampling platform. The effectiveness of the proposed methods are explored in simulated scalar fields for identifying multiple regions of interest within a three-dimensional environment. Field experiments with an AUV using both virtual measurements on a known scalar field and in situ dissolved oxygen measurements for studying hypoxic zones validate the approach's capability to quickly explore the given area, and then subsequently increase the sampling density around regions of interest without sacrificing model fidelity of the full sampling area.},
